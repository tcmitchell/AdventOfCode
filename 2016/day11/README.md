It's possible to prune more of the branches by canonicalizing
and sorting the world state.

See https://andars.github.io/aoc_day11.html, "Cutting some branches, Part II"
for info about a representation. That representation is sortable, so any
"mirror" world state should reduce to a similar pattern and thus be pruned.
